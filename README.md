# coub_downloader
The video sharing website Coub has announced it's closure. So I want a way to save all my liked coubs from the website.


Currently it can download a file, if one gives it a link.

To-do:
* Mass community download
* probably more stuff, can't remember rn.

# How to use
VERY VERY VERY EARLY STAGE!
You can see which libraries are being used, by taking a look at the coub-dll.py file.
So install those.

Other than that, do this:
1) Clone the repo.
2) Inside the repo, add 2 folders:
	* temp
	* result
3) Open coub-dll.py up in some sort of editor
4) Go down towards the button and the find line that says "coubs_to_download", and change the values to whatever coub you want to download.
5) Run the program.

This process will be made a lot easier in the future, but for now, it is what it is. As I said, still very early stage.
