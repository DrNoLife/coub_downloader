# coub_downloader
The video sharing website Coub has announced it's closure. So I want a way to save all my liked coubs from the website.

Very rough and direct video showing how to use the program: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZyFNhzX4Rg

Further guide on how to download all liked videos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JP9CT-RUng

**If you have the requirements installed, AND Git, you can use this video as a reference for how to use the program:** <br />

## Extra notes

**NEW BRANCH** <br />
I created a new branch called "optimization". You can go ahead and download the content from that one instread. There are 2 differences between the two branches:

1. Changed where in the code I look for duplicate downloads, before it took roughly 1 second (because I called the API first), but now it should be basically instantly.
2. Changed how the community crawling works. Now the user only needs to supply the community link, and not the sorting. Instead the program now goes through a few different links (/fresh, /rising, /monthly, /quarter, /half). This is to make sure we get as many coubs as we possibly can. <br />This does however mean, that it takes a lot longer to go through a community now (roughly, 4 - 5 times longer).

If these changes are worth it for you, change to the other branch.

### New new new update.

Right so another update: 

**Community crawler now works** and it supports ordering. It will always sort by "most popular", but the user decides if it's by *views* or *likes*. 

After using the community crawler, the text document "coubs_to_download.txt" should be filled with many, many, hundreds of links.<br/>
If this is the case, then use the program *coub-dll.py*. This will go through that list, and download every single video.

Added progress bar, a better "completed" list and something else I forgot.

# How to use

Make sure you have Python installed.

Make sure you have the libraries required installed (check a bit further down to see which ones are needed).

After than, go ahead and download / clone the repo. <br />
After download, we need to fix a few things, so do the following:

1) Inside the repo, open the file *completed_coubs.txt*.
2) Delete all content within this file. After that, save it and close the file.
3) Create 2 folders inside the repo.
	* result
	* temp

After you've cleaned out the text file and added the two folders, we should be ready.

You can use the *coubs_to_download.txt* file to mention which coubs should be downloaded. <br />
Each line should represent a link to a coub, example: 

```
https://coub.com/view/31159x
https://coub.com/view/30ysj6
https://coub.com/view/3113aa
```

After this, you can save the file and close it. Now run the *coub-dll.py* file by using your Terminal / CMD / Powershell. <br />
The result of this will be saved in the, result folder.

If you want to mass download from communities, do the following:

1) Find the link to the community, example: coub.com/community/anime
2) Open the text file *community_to_crawl.txt* and replace the very first line with your link.
3) The second line can be used to change the ordering (views_count vs likes_count).
4) After this, save the file and close it.
5) Now run the python file *crawl_community_save_to_list.py*

After this is complete, just run the other program again, just like before. This will download all the videos found by the crawler.

## Requirements for the program

You need to have Python installed (I used the latest version). <br />
https://www.python.org/downloads/

The program needs the following libraries:
* ffmpeg
* ffmpeg-python
* requests
* json
* urllib.request
* subprocess
* os
* shutil

If you don't have them installed, use pip to install them:

```
pip install requests
```

### NOTICE REGARDING FFMPEG

You also need to add ffmpeg to your system environment path. If you don't know how to do this, Google for it. It's relatively straight forward.

## community_to_crawl.txt
This text file decides what community we'll look for coubs in. Only 2 lines should exist in this text document, and it should use this syntax:

```txt
https://coub.com/community/anime
order:views_count
```

The *"views_count"* can be exchanged for *"likes_count"*.

# Notes
This website was really good, for showing what API endspoints to use.
https://github-wiki-see.page/m/HelpSeeker/CoubDownloader/wiki/Coub-API

I realize the documentation is a bit wack right now, but honestly, it's a rushed job this project, and it works fine for me. <br />
I don't have the time to make it more user friendly, I'm sorry, but school is quite needy.
