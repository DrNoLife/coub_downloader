# coub_downloader
The video sharing website Coub has announced it's closure. So I want a way to save all my liked coubs from the website.

# To-Do
I have a few more things planned for it. But I want to set this straight, I don't plan on making a "proper" GUI for the program.<br/>
With that said, what I do plan on doing is: Create a way to go through your entire list of "Liked" coubs. This is not exposed from the API, as far as I could see, but I did find a way that would make it possible.

## Extra notes
Right so another update: 

**Community crawler now works** and it supports ordering. It will always sort by "most popular", but the user decides if it's by *views* or *likes*. 

After using the community crawler, the text document "coubs_to_download.txt" should be filled with many, many, hundreds of links.<br/>
If this is the case, then use the program *coub-dll.py*. This will go through that list, and download every single video.

Added progress bar, a better "completed" list and something else I forgot.

# How to use
VERY VERY VERY EARLY STAGE!
You can see which libraries are being used, by taking a look at the coub-dll.py file.
So install those.

Other than that, do this:
1) Clone the repo.
2) Inside the repo, add 2 folders:
	* temp
	* result
3) Open coub-dll.py up in some sort of editor
4) Go down towards the button and the find line that says "coubs_to_download", and change the values to whatever coub you want to download.
5) Run the program.

This process will be made a lot easier in the future, but for now, it is what it is. As I said, still very early stage.

## Requirements for the program

You need to have Python installed (I used the latest version). <br />
https://www.python.org/downloads/

The program needs the following libraries:
* ffmpeg
* requests
* json
* urllib.request
* subprocess
* os
* shutil

If you don't have them installed, use pip to install them:

```
pip install requests
```

## community_to_crawl.txt
This text file decides what community we'll look for coubs in. Only 2 lines should exist in this text document, and it should use this syntax:

```txt
https://coub.com/community/anime
order:views_count
```

The *"views_count"* can be exchanged for *"likes_count"*.

# Notes
This website was really good, for showing what API endspoints to use.
